          <h1>Meeting & Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            Everything begins with an introduction! At the very instant you meet
            an elephant you have to let him/her catch your smell, that is how
            they know you. After that, you need to comfort the elephant by
            stroking on the trunk and talking at the same time. The contact here
            we are talking about is more spiritual than physical let the
            elephant feel your positive energy. The most astonishing thing here
            is that to communicate with elephants there is a certain language
            that they understand very well. We teach you some basics of this
            language so that you can communicate with elephants yourself.

          <h1>Feeding the elephant</h1>
          <p>
            To tell you, elephants like to eat, especially if you have a banana
            and another fruit's. The next favorite on the list is Sugar Cane.
            Elephants can feed for hours without interruption!! have a big
            appetite. In our garden, we give you information about what and how
            we feed them with what special ingredients we provide to defeat the
            heat. Because of their size, they can absorb food from the ground to
            tall trees. They can even use the stems to produce fruit that cannot
            be reached by other species. They are very smart in terms of getting
            food. You will not leave this food source and let other animals come
            with you.

          <h1>Painting on elephant</h1>
          <p>
            Well, the painting will be one of the most intriguing parts of your
            visit. We call them "MOVING CANVAS", as when you paint them you will
            experience the same. The color we use here is water/herbal colors
            easy to put easy to wash away, keeping the skin of elephant safe.

          <h1>Take A walk with Elephants</h1>
          <p>
            Every Elephant needs to walk at least 9 - 10 kilometers as they have
            a very poor digestion system so it's always better for them to walk.
            Elephant walk is good for them, it's same as we do a workout. We
            allow people only for the walk with them.
